## Motivations

**Tailwind classes Authority** is created as an free alternative documentation solution to [Docus](https://docus.dev/) and [Nuxt UI Pro Docs](https://docs-template.nuxt.dev/).

As docus is [discontinued](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/docus/issues/1016), I wanted a new docs solution. Vitepress is nice but I love nuxt content's easy customizability. The Nuxt team did an incredible job building the Nuxt UI Pro Docs template, but $249 is a lot for independent developers. So I made this in about a week.

## Features

- Framework agnostic.
- SSR friendly.
- Intuitive.
- Powered by tailwind merge to produce minimum classes efficiently.
